# Mental-Health-At-Work-Place



The "Mental Health at Workplace" project leverages machine learning techniques to identify, analyze, and address mental health issues within the workplace environment. This project aims to create a comprehensive system that can detect early signs of mental health challenges, provide insights into the contributing factors, and suggest interventions to promote a healthier work environment.
